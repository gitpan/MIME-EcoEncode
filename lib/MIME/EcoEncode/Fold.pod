This is a module for folding multi-byte string.

SMTP server may insert line feed code
and the multi-byte string might break.
This module was written in order to prevent it.

  $folded = mime_eco_fold($str, $charset, $lf, $bpl);
               # $charset : 'UTF-8' / 'GB2312' / 'EUC-KR' / 'Big5' /
               #            'Shift_JIS' / 'ISO-2022-JP' / ...
               #            (default: 'UTF-8')
               #              Note: The others are all folded as
               #                    single-byte string.
               # $lf      : line feed (default: "\n ")
               # $bpl     : bytes per line (default: 990)
               #              Note: 990 is postfix's default.
